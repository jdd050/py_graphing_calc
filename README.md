# Python Graphing Calculator
A graphing calculator made in python.

## History
This project was originally made for my high school CS Performance Task, which is the version of this application that uses the Turtle graphics library to graph functions. I later revisited this project to optimize it and decided to change the graphing method to matplotlib.
